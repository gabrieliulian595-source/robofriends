RoboFriends is a modern, single-page web application built with React, designed to showcase efficent state management, component-driven architecture, and real-time UI interactions. The application retrieves user data from an external API and displays a dynamic list of robot profiles. A responsive search feature allows users to filter robots instantly as they type, demonstrating performant rendering and clean data-flow patterns.

This project highlights proficiency in React fundamentals, asynchronous data handling, reusable UI components, and deployment of production-ready front-end applications. It is structured for clarity, scalability, and maintainability, making in an excellent example of clean front-end engineering practices.
